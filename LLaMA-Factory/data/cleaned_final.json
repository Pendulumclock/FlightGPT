The target also specifies a white car at the back of this row with a bright blue round object to its right. The red mask in the image indicates the location of Park Terrace, which is the relevant landmark for this description.\n\nThe target is described as being near the red-masked landmark (Park Terrace), so we need to determine the relative position of the target within the red-masked area. The target is described as being between Park Terrace Footpath and Park Terrace Road, with the row of cars and the target object being to the right of the white car.\n\nGiven the visual scene, the red mask at the left side of the image indicates Park Terrace. The target is described as being near the red-masked landmark, so we can infer that the target is within the red-masked area.\n\nThe bounding box for the red-masked landmark region is:\n```json\n{\"landmark_bbox\": [0, 0, 397, 678]}\n```\n\nSince the target is described as being between Park Terrace Footpath and Park Terrace Road, the target is likely within the red-masked area, specifically near the intersection of Park Terrace Footpath and Park Terrace Road.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n{\"target_location\": [150, 300]}\n```\n</think>\n<answer>\n```json\n{\"target_location\": [150, 300]}\n```\n</answer>",
